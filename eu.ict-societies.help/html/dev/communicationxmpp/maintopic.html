<h1>Communication / XMPP</h1>

The goal of the Communication Framework is to create a Wired Protocol, i.e. a documented set of XML communication stanzas. This means that our solution does not pass Java classes between Client/Server and therefore locks our clients to Java only. With this architecture, other development languages can invoke SOCIETIES node services and be part of our solution, eg. a .NET or a Python client.<br />
<br />
Understanding how the communication framework works is a fundamental prerequisite for Third Party service developers that want to integrate their services with SOCIETIES Nodes, be it to provide the node with additional informations or to exploit the functionalities that the platform exposes externally.
