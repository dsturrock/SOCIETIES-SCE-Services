<h1>Creating an Event Type</h1>

To define your custom event types, add them to the EventTypes.java class in the External API project, package org.societies.api.osgi.event:
<pre>
/**Used by Service Management (Service Discovery) to notify a local peer of a failed service */
public static final String ADD_SERVICE_EVENT="org/societies/servicemgmt/service/addservice";

/**Used by Service Management (Service Discovery) to notify peers of a removed service*/
public static final String REMOVED_SERVICE_EVENT="org/societies/servicemgmt/service/removeservice";
</pre>
