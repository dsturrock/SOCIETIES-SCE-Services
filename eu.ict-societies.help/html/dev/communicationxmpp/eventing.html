<h1>Eventing</h1>

The eventing and pubsub feature provided by the SOCIETIES Platform allows Third Party service developers to exploit those designs patterns within their services. There are currently 2 eventing models available.
<ol>
<li>Internal eventing between bundles within the container using the OSGI EventAdmin. Events only available to bundles running within the same container. Supports native java objects as payloads</li>
<li>External eventing between conecting clients (including other containers). Allows a CSS Node to create an event stream for other clients (CSS nodes) to subscribe to. Supports schema generated objects only as payload</li>
</ol>

The Pubsub service is dependent on the communication framework. For further details about it see section 3.5. The examples in this section refer to the code available on <a href="https://github.com/societies/SOCIETIES-Platform/tree/development/platform-infrastructure/comms-frwk/ExampleServices">GitHub</a>).
