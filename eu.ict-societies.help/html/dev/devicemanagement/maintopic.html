<h1>Device Management</h1>

This section provides guidelines regarding the use of the SOCIETIES Device Management facilities by Third Party context-aware services. The Device Management (DM) component acts as an intermediate layer between sensors and actuators attached to a CSS node and managed by a Third Party service. A Third Party service example using the DM component, and other DM related projects, can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/societies/SOCIETIES-Platform/tree/development/css-modules/device-mgmt">GitHub Code Repository</a>.
