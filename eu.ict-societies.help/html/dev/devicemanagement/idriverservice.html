<h1>IDriverService Example Usage</h1>

This is a provided interface, it is used by the Third Party service to interact with the device, i.e. controlling an actuator or getting data from a sensor.
<pre>
IDevice screen1 = iDevice;
IDriverService driverService = screen1.getService(DeviceMgmtDriverServiceNames.SCREEN_DRIVER_SERVICE);
IAction ia = driverService.getAction("<span style="color: #FF0000;">displayMessage</span>");
</pre>
 
Notice that, in the code snippet above, the Action "displayMessage" is not associated to any Model class (as the Action Model class does not yet exist). This example is a typical example of an ad-hoc semantic information defined by the driver provider without using a Model approach. This is very inconvenient because using "free-text" strings with implied semantics poses a very high risk of inconsistencies in behaviour and reduces the reliability of integrating a wider set of devices.
