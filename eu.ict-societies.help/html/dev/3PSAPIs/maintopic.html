<h1>3rd Party Service APIs</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>

The SOCIETIES platform exposes its functionality to 3rd party services via a set of external APIs. This API set is composed by Java Interfaces, XML Schemas and Android Interfaces. The Java Interfaces are designed to be invoked locally from 3rd party services which are deployed within the same runtime as the SOCIETIES cloud/rich nodes. The XML schema APIs allow for remote, standards-based communication via XMPP, regardless of the implementation technology of the communicating 3rd party services, thus providing a platform agnostic API. Finally, the Android Interfaces provide a local invocation point for Android applications to utilise the features of the SOCIETIES APIs, thus reducing the impact of unnecessary remote messages from Android devices (i.e. light client node) to Cloud nodes.
