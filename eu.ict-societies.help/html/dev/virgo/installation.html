<h1>Virgo Installation</h1>
<p>To install Virgo Tomcat Server on Linux, unzip the distribution package to the desired installation directory. For example, to install into /opt:</p>
<pre class="code">
prompt$ unzip virgo-web-server-3.0.1.RELEASE.zip -d /opt
</pre>
<p>This creates a directory called virgo-web-server-3.0.1.RELEASE under /opt.</p>
<p>Virgo Tomcat Server requires write access to the installation directory, in this case /opt/virgo-web-server-3.0.1.RELEASE. Typically this means it must be run as the user that installed it, or the installation directory's ownership must be changed.</p>
<p>To install the Virgo Tomcat Server on Windows, unzip the distribution package to the desired installation directory. Note that both Windows and Java have some issues with long file names and file paths, so we recommend installing to the root directory of your chosen drive.</p>
