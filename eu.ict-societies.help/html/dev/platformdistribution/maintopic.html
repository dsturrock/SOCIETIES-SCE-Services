<h1>SOCIETIES Platform Distribution</h1>

At the time of writing this deliverable, the SOCIETIES platform is distributed in the form of source code, publicly available at <a href="https://github.com/societies/SOCIETIES-Platform">https://github.com/societies/SOCIETIES-Platform</a><br />
<br />
In the "builder" sub-folder within the structure of the project, two Maven configuration files are made available to build the sets of components that are relevant for the light nodes and the rich/cloud nodes: android-projects.xml and spring-osgi-projects.xml, respectively.<br />
<br />
Building the SOCIETIES platform of choice is thus as simple as invoking:<br />
<br />
<div style="width: 100%;" align="center">
<i>mvn -f [android|spring-osgi]-projects.xml clean install</i>
</div>
<br />
from a command-line shell within the builder folder.<br />
<br />
In the same folder, two Virgo plan files are available to list the required components on a Rich/Client node:<br />
<br />
1.      <b>societies-platform.plan</b> lists all components required by the platform to provide its full set of functionalities<br />
<br />
2.      <b>societies-3p-services.plan</b> lists the set of bundles that 3rd Party services might require<br />
<br />
A more user-friendly packaging of the SOCIETIES platform distributions is being considered and will be described in D6.2, the final version of this deliverable.<br />
<br />
Technical support for 3rd party service developers will be provided through online collaboration tools (guidelines & tutorials, bug reporting, forums, etc) available at <a href="https://redmine.ict-societies.eu/projects/sp">https://redmine.ict-societies.eu/projects/sp</a> (user registration required).<br />
